        <h1> Only Cypress Trees!</h1>
        
        <p>This is my collection of Ancient Old Growth Cypress tree logging! <br><br>Cypress trees are the most flood tolerant tree of all the species in North America, and only grow in areas that are underwater for longer periods than the surrounding marshlands.<br><br> 
        Cypress trees contain a naturally occurring preservative called <b>cypressene</b>, and is produced in cypress heartwood, making it resistant to insects, rot, decay, and other damaging elements. Pressure- treating cypress with chemicals that can be harmful to the environment, a process required for some species to maintain their strength and appearance, is not necessary. <br><br>
        Due to their ability to withstand rot and decay, Cypress trees have a long history of being harvested for lumber. The invention of the power saw did no mercy for the Cypress industry and with <b>millions</b> of boardfeet of lumber being removed from our swamps, every year. I am thankful we still have what was left behind. Let these pictures in their respective collections remind us how things once were. Being a Cypress lumberjack back in the day, was the most respected and hardcore lumberjack, often working in waist deep water infested with gators and snakes!<br>

It was purchased in 1977 by authorization of the Governor and Cabinet under the Environmentally Endangered Lands program. A primary reason for purchase was the allegation that the tract was a pristine setting. An indepth field evaluation indicates that the tract is far from being pristine.The tract is bisected repeatedly by highways, powerline easements, canals, dikes, and roads. Also, cattle grazing occurs throughout the tract. Fences, corrals, loading ramps, and cow camps are interspersed throughout the Tosohatchee. At the time of purchase the tract was believed to have had 2,800 acres of cypress swamp. A cruise of the pine stand by a team of ten foresters indicate that there are not 2,800 acres of cypress on the tract. The predominantly cypress stand is approximately 600 acres in size. </p><hr>
