    <p>Found throughout the world, with species native to almost every continent, Cypress Trees are a beautiful, and versatile tree. There are over 25 genera and almost 130 species. The many different types of Cypress trees around the world are well adapted to any spot, climate, and habitat.</p>
    <h2> American Cypress Trees (Bald cypress, Red cypress, Yellow cypress, Southern cypress)</h2>
    <p>Cypress trees are conifers, but unlike most American softwoods, they are deciduous trees that shed foliage in the fall like hardwoods. Although cypress is a softwood, it grows alongside hardwoods and is traditionally grouped and manufactured with hardwoods.</p>
    <p>Most cypress trees are natives of the South and grow in the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains from Delaware to Texas, as well as in the Mississippi Valley from the Louisiana Delta to southern Indiana.</p>
    <p>Cypress roots love water. Some trees growing on wet sites develop what are called cypress “knees” or pneumatophores. The knee-like upright growths come from the roots, helping to support the tree and also to aerate the waterlogged root system. The wood from the knees is soft and light and can be used to makes vases and novelty items.</p>
